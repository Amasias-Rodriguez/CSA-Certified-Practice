# SOC Analyst Lab Practice

This repository documents my step-by-step practice in cybersecurity with a focus on **Security Operations Center (SOC)** tasks.  
The goal is to simulate real SOC workflows using virtual machines (Kali Linux and Metasploitable) in a safe lab environment.

## What will be covered
- Network traffic monitoring with **tcpdump** and **Wireshark**  
- Identifying normal vs. suspicious network activity  
- Simulating attacks in a controlled environment using vulnerable VMs  
- Building a structured documentation of SOC use cases  

## Lab Setup
- **Kali Linux** → Analyst/attacker machine  
- **Metasploitable / Additional VM** → Target/victim machine
